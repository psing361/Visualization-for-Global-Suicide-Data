# Visualization-for-Global-Suicide-Data
The objective of the visualization is to identify the segments of the population for the health organizations to focus on suicide cases.
The health organization wants to understand which segment of the population they should focus the most in order to bring down the Suicide Rates.
Along with this they also want to understand what factors are causing people to commit suicides. 
Hence they need to understand whether the low HDI (index of life expectancy, the standard of living and education) is leading people to end their own lives.
